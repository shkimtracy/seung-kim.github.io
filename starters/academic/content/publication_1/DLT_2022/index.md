abstract: "Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), like Blockchain, could help improve brand safety, consumer privacy and transparency in digital advertising. However, paid advertisements transfer attention, money, and data between three parties: advertiser, consumer, and publisher. Therefore advertising-focused DLTs face more complex design considerations than currency-focused DLTs. We describe four key DLT characteristics: structure, participation/governance, transparency, and terms of exchange. We survey current advertising-focused DLTs and find they each serve only two of the three contracting parties in advertising transactions. We make design recommendations for future advertising-focused DLTs, including a goal of serving both consumers and publishers in addition to advertisers. We also recommend governance, transparency and terms-of-trade considerations. Advertising-focused DLTs have significant promise but also significant obstacles, including multi-sided “chicken-and-egg” problems in standards adoption."
